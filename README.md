# symbolbook
symbolbook is a Qt based gui tool for searching symbols in static libraries (.lib).

The main purpose of this tool is to provide a relative easy to use mechanism to find a linkable symbol inside a set of static libraries.
If your organization uses a lot of in house made libraries with a lot of undocumented symbols, a tool like this could be pretty useful and it could help you not wasting your time.
